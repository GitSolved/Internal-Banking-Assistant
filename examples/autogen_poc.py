    CISA Alert AA25-290A: Ransomware Variant Targeting Financial Institutions

    Summary:
    The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has identified
    a new ransomware variant specifically targeting banking and financial services
    organizations. The malware, dubbed "FinLock," exploits CVE-2025-1234 in
    widely-used core banking software.

    Technical Details:
    - CVE ID: CVE-2025-1234
    - CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)
    - Affected Systems: CoreBanking Suite v12.x - v14.3
    - Attack Vector: Network-accessible API vulnerability
    - First Observed: October 15, 2025

    Impact:
    - 15+ financial institutions affected globally
    - Average ransom demand: $2.5M
    - Data exfiltration confirmed in 80% of cases
    - Customer PII and transaction data at risk

    Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
    - IP: 192.0.2.100
    - Domain: finlock-c2.example[.]com
    - File Hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6...

    Recommendations:
    1. Immediate patching of CoreBanking Suite to v14.4+
    2. Network segmentation review
    3. Enhanced monitoring of API endpoints
    4. Incident response plan activation
