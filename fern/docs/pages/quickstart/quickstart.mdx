This guide provides a quick start for running different profiles of PrivateGPT using Docker Compose.
The profiles cater to various environments, including Ollama setups (CPU, CUDA, MacOS), and a fully local setup.

By default, Docker Compose will download pre-built images from a remote registry when starting the services. However, you have the option to build the images locally if needed. Details on building Docker image locally are provided at the end of this guide.

If you want to run PrivateGPT locally without Docker, refer to the [Local Installation Guide](/installation).

## Prerequisites
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Ensure both are installed on your system.
  [Installation Guide for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Installation Guide for Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Clone PrivateGPT Repository:** Clone the PrivateGPT repository to your machine and navigate to the directory:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-org/private-gpt.git
  cd private-gpt
  ```
